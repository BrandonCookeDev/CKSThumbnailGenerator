### Required Software
 * Node JS [Click to go to site](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 
### Languages Used
 * HTML 5
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 	* JQuery
 	* AngularJS
 
### Instructions
 * Download Node JS from the link above.
 * After downloading and installing, you will use the command line and travel to the directory you've cloned the above project into.
 * Once here, you should write
 	* "npm install"
 		* (This command will install all required dependencies for the project into your project directory)
 * After running this command you should be able to run the program using this command:
 	* "npm start"
 	* If this command does not work, you can go into the server directory and execute:
 		* "node app.js"
 * The above command should host the application on localhost:1337. Just Open Chrome and type that in, and you will go to the app.
 
### Using the App
 * The app mostly is supposed to be like a workflow where you go down in steps. 
 * However there are definitely a few bugs that need to be sorted out after we get a working build out first.
 * Steps for Singles Matches:
 	* First choose a background image file. It will populate in the HTML canvas.
 	* Next choose the characters the players in the match selected.
 	* After this, click "Default Nameplate" twice.
 		* This is temporary until we get Custom Nameplate functionality working,
 	* Once then, type the names into the boxes
 	* Type the tournament round into the box
 	* Select the text's color with the color pickers
 	* Click submit names
 	* Choose a tournament logo file (THIS NEEDS TO WORK)
 	* Click Default Stream Logo
 	* OPTIONAL: Choose a game logo (THIS NEEDS TO WORK)
 	* Click arrow below picture to download.
 	
### MAJOR NOTE:
 * You may have to click things like "Default Nameplate" and "Default Stream Logo" in order to repaint them over things again so they show up in front.
 * Also you may have to resubmit names if you choose things like different characters and etc.
